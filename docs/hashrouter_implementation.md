# HashRouter Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the necessary changes to migrate from BrowserRouter to HashRouter while preserving all existing functionality.

## Required Changes

### 1. App.jsx Modifications
- [x] Replace `BrowserRouter` import with `HashRouter` from 'react-router-dom'
- [x] Update the Router component to use HashRouter
- [x] Remove basename prop since HashRouter doesn't need it

### 2. ProtectedRoute.jsx Updates
- [x] Review all navigation logic to ensure compatibility with hash-based URLs
- [x] Update any direct path comparisons (e.g., window.location.pathname) to work with hash URLs

### 3. Components Using Navigation
- [x] Verify all components using `useNavigate()` or `Link` components work with hash URLs
- [x] Update DeckListPage.jsx and other navigation-dependent components if needed

## Implementation Steps
1. [x] First update App.jsx to use HashRouter
2. [x] Test basic navigation flows
3. [x] Update ProtectedRoute.jsx for hash URL compatibility
4. [x] Verify all navigation in child components
5. [x] Deploy and test in production environment

## Expected Benefits
- Better compatibility with static file hosting
- No need for server-side URL rewriting
- Preserved existing functionality with minimal changes
